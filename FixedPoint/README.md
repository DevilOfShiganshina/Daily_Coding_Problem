# Program

This problem was asked by Apple.

A fixed point in an array is an element\
whose value is equal to its index. Given\
a sorted array of distinct elements,\
return a fixed point, if one exists.\
Otherwise, return False.

For example, given [-6, 0, 2, 40], you\
should return 2. Given [1, 5, 7, 8], you\
should return False.

## Possible Program Output

```
FixedPoint$ ./exe
The original array is: -6 0 2 40
The fixed point is: 2

FixedPoint$ ./exe
The original array is: -1 5 7 8
List contains no fixed points!
```

## Time complexity

O(logN)
