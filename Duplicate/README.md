This Problem was asked by Google

You are given an array of length n + 1 whose.\
elements belong to the set {1, 2, ..., n}.\
By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a\
duplicate. Find it in linear time and constant space.

# Program output

```
Duplicate$ ./exe 
The duplicate element is: 4
```

# Time and Space Complexity

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
