Write a program that determines the smallest\
number of perfect squares that sum up to N.

Here are a few examples:

Given N = 4, return 1 (4)\
Given N = 17, return 2 (16 + 1)\
Given N = 18, return 2 (9 + 9)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest\
number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13,\
return 2 since 13 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 4.

Given n = 27,\
return 3 since 27 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 9 + 9.

# Program Output

```
PerfSquareSum$ ./exe
Please enter an integer greater than 0: 27
N: 27   Num of minimum perfect squares: 3
```
